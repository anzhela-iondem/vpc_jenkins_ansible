# VPC and EC2s
This terraform code creates a VPC with 3 public subnets with an internet gateway, 2 private subnets with a NAT gateway, and two isolated (database) subnets.\
Also creates one EC2 instance with the already installed Jenkins master in a public subnet and one EC2 with the already installed Ansible Master in a private subnet.

After creating the infrastructure, the code outputs the IPs of the two EC2s and IDs of the VPC and its subnets.

e.g.\
Outputs:

ansible_private_ip = "10.100.101.109"\
database_subnet_1_id = "subnet-0dcf55b9c0e2b1610"\
database_subnet_2_id = "subnet-09f13ca70399fc59e"\
jenkins_private_ip = "10.100.1.252"\
jenkins_public_ip = "3.120.210.127"\
private_subnet_1_id = "subnet-0bce954dbdb0c32bf"\
private_subnet_2_id = "subnet-00e924fbacdbb9179"\
public_subnet_1_id = "subnet-020ee954f855615e1"\
public_subnet_2_id = "subnet-05656f14c922bfbb0"\
public_subnet_3_id = "subnet-0301ad11271320512"\
vpc_id = "vpc-0a586e5b5708fff72"
